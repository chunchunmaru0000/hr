args to compiler

UNREPEATABLE flag for an enum

let a, b, c, d byte "hello world"
so plist of names in let statement of the assembly

^ xor, better chose another thing
~ bit not, inverts all bits, ~1 = -2

do ',' fun arg types like the ones that are possible in function signature but
function variable signature

атом ( ... )

source code comments in assembly, need to get the last token of an instruction also

*ч32 == *[ч32], so arr type is equal to just the type, array only haves size

when i will have defns as a dictionary then i can do maybe #undef
